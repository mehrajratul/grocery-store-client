This is a simple React application that uses Firebase for user authentication. It also includes private routes, a product listing page, a product management page for deleting products, and an "Add Product" feature. Below, you'll find information on how to set up and use this application.


Usage:

Authentication:
The app allows users to sign up and sign in using the Firebase authentication system. You can customize the authentication methods in the Firebase Console.

To sign up, users can register with their email and password.
To sign in, users can use their registered credentials.
Private Routes
This app includes private routes, which means that some routes are accessible only to authenticated users. To set up a route as private, use the PrivateRoute component provided in the src/components/PrivateRoute.js file. To create new private routes, add them to the src/App.js file.

Manage Products:
On the "Manage Products" page, authenticated users can delete products. This functionality is available to authorized users only. You can customize the product data and how products are deleted by modifying the code in the src/components/ManageProducts.js file.

Add Products:
The "Add Product" page allows authenticated users to add new products. You can customize the product fields and data submission process in the src/components/AddProduct.js file.
